The goal of `dpdr` is to provide a programmatic interface to the Health Canada Drug Product Database API.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `dpdr` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("oncology-outcomes/dpdr")
```

## Usage

There are 11 API endpoints as part of Health Canada's Drug Product Database API. Each of these endpoints will be demonstrated in the following sections.

```{r}
library(dpdr)
```

### Active Ingredient

We can search for active ingredient information based on the drug code...

```{r}
dpd_ai_id(48905)
```

Or based on the name of a drug.

```{r}
dpd_ai_name('afatinib')
```

### Company

We can search for information about a drug company:

```{r}
dpd_company(10825)
```

### Drug Product

The family of drug product functions allow us to query information about drug products based on the drug id or drug identification number (DIN).

```{r}
dpd_drug_id(2049)
```

```{r}
dpd_drug_din('00326925')
```

We can also find the list of drugs based on the drugs product status (see `?dpd_drug_status` for more information).

```{r}
dpd_drug_status(6)
```

Lastly, we can find all possible DINs associated with a drug name.

```{r}
dpd_drug_dins('afatinib')
```

### Dosage Form

The dosage form is form of presentation in which the product is supplied. We can query dosage form based on the drug product code.

```{r}
dpd_dosage(10846)
```

### Packaging

We can query the information about package sizes based on the drug product code.

```{r}
dpd_packaging(11685)
```

### Pharmaceutical Standard

We can query the standard to which the drug product is manufactured and represented, based on the drug product code.

```{r}
dpd_pharm_std(11534)
```

### Route of Administration

We can query the route of administration for a drug based on the drug product code.

```{r}
dpd_route(3)
```

### Schedule

Each drug is assigned one or more schedules, we can query this based on the drug product code (see `?dpd_schedule` for more information).

```{r}
dpd_schedule(10687)
```

### Product Status

We can query the status of a drug product based on the drug product code.

```{r}
dpd_status(10229)
```

### Therapeutic Class

We can query the Therapeutic Class according to a drugs main therapeutic use.

```{r}
dpd_class(10564)
```

### Veterinary Species

Lastly, we can query the species for a drug product based on the veterinary drug product code.

```{r}
dpd_vet_species(13755)
```
